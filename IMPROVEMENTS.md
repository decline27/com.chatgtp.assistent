## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Before Improvements
```
User: "turn on the lights in the living room"
Bot: "7/8 devices updated in Vardagsrummet
✅ Matrum: turn_on successful (socket - unwanted)
✅ Tv Hörn: turn_on successful (socket - unwanted)
✅ Soffa hörna: turn_on successful (light)
✅ Soffa hörna: turn_on successful (light)
✅ Soffa hörna: turn_on successful (light)
✅ Golvlampa: turn_on successful (light)
❌ Vardagsrum 2: There is no content in the playback queue (speaker)
✅ Living Room: turn_on successful (camera - unwanted)"
```

### After Improvements
```
User: "turn on the ligt in the livingroom"

## 📝 Configuration

No additional configuration is required. The improvements work with existing API keys and settings. The system automatically detects available devices and rooms from your Homey setup.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the Homey app logs for detailed error information
2. Use `/status` command to verify system connectivity
3. Try `/help` for usage examples
