1. Leverage Homey's Built-In Capabilities
HTTP Requests:
Homey apps can use Node.js’s native https or http modules instead of axios. Homey may also offer its own network utilities (e.g., the fetch API available in some environments) that you can use for making HTTP calls.

File Handling:
The Node.js built-in fs module is available in Homey. You can use it for writing temporary files (e.g., saving a downloaded voice file).

Environment Variables:
Instead of using dotenv, you can set up configuration via Homey's app settings (using Homey.ManagerSettings) or use a configuration file. This keeps the dependency count low while still allowing you to manage sensitive data like API keys.

Telegram Integration:
Instead of installing node-telegram-bot-api, you could implement a lightweight integration using Homey's built-in HTTP server or a simple polling mechanism. This would mean manually handling Telegram API calls (using Homey’s HTTP capabilities) rather than relying on a third-party package.

ChatGPT Integration:
For sending requests to ChatGPT, you can use the native https module or Homey’s own network functions rather than the openai package.

Form Data Handling:
If your speech-to-text API requires multipart form data, you might need to write your own minimal implementation or use Node.js’s built-in modules rather than a package like form-data.

2. Adjusting the Instructions to Avoid New Dependencies
Below is an outline of how you might adjust each module:

A. Telegram Module Without New Dependencies
Polling or Webhook:
Create your own HTTP request handler using Homey’s built-in HTTP server.
For example, if Homey provides a way to open a port for incoming webhooks, configure Telegram to send updates to that URL.
If long polling is needed, use the native https module to periodically poll the Telegram API.

Example:
Instead of using node-telegram-bot-api, write functions like getUpdates, sendMessage, and getFile that use native HTTP calls.
Use Homey’s logging and scheduling features to manage polling intervals.

B. HTTP Requests Using Node.js Native Modules
Making a GET or POST Request:
Replace axios calls with native https requests.
For instance, here’s a simplified example of a GET request using Node.js's built-in https module:

javascript
Copy
const https = require('https');

function httpGet(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    https.get(url, (res) => {
      let data = '';
      res.on('data', chunk => data += chunk);
      res.on('end', () => resolve(data));
    }).on('error', reject);
  });
}
Posting Data:
You can similarly build a POST function by using the https.request method with the correct options.

C. Speech-to-Text Module Without form-data
Sending Multipart Form Data:
If you need to send a file to the speech-to-text API, you can either craft the multipart form data manually (which is more involved) or verify if the API offers a simpler JSON-based endpoint.
Otherwise, you might include a very lightweight utility that you write in-house for constructing the multipart request.
D. ChatGPT Integration Without the OpenAI Package
Native HTTPS Calls:
Instead of using the openai package, use the native HTTPS module to construct your POST request to the ChatGPT endpoint.
For example:

javascript
Copy
const https = require('https');

function postToChatGPT(prompt) {
  const data = JSON.stringify({
    model: "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }],
    temperature: 0,
  });

  const options = {
    hostname: 'api.openai.com',
    path: '/v1/chat/completions',
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Content-Length': Buffer.byteLength(data),
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`
    }
  };

  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const req = https.request(options, (res) => {
      let responseBody = '';
      res.on('data', chunk => responseBody += chunk);
      res.on('end', () => resolve(JSON.parse(responseBody)));
    });
    req.on('error', reject);
    req.write(data);
    req.end();
  });
}
E. Homey SDK 3.0 Integration
Using Homey's Built-In Modules:
Since Homey SDK 3.0 is native to your app, continue using its provided methods (e.g., Homey.ManagerDevices.getDevice(), device.setCapabilityValue()) without change.
This part already leverages Homey's native system and does not require external dependencies.
3. Summary & Recommendations
Clear Separation:
All code should reside within the Homey app environment. Use the Homey CLI to create your project, and then build your modules using only Homey’s built-in Node.js runtime features and the Homey SDK 3.0.

No Extra Dependencies:
If your goal is to avoid installing new dependencies, rewrite the modules that currently depend on external libraries (like node-telegram-bot-api, axios, dotenv, and openai) using Homey’s built-in capabilities and Node.js core modules (https, fs, etc.).

Resource and Lifecycle Management:
Be aware that Homey devices have resource constraints. A lean implementation using native modules will help minimize memory and CPU usage, ensuring that your integration runs reliably within the Homey ecosystem.

Testing:
As always, thorough testing on an actual Homey device is crucial to ensure that your custom-built integrations (like your Telegram polling mechanism and native HTTPS requests) work as expected within Homey’s managed runtime environment.
